  title={Hierarchical Verbalizer for Few-Shot Hierarchical Text Classification},
  author={Ke Ji and Yixin Lian and Jingsheng Gao and Baoyuan Wang},
  abstract={We propose the hierarchical verbalizer ("HierVerb"), a multi-verbalizer framework treating HTC as a single- or multi-label classification problem at multiple layers and learning vectors as verbalizers constrained by hierarchical structure and hierarchical contrastive learning.},

  title={LiveChat: A Large-Scale Personalized Dialogue Dataset Automatically Constructed from Live Streaming},
  author={Jingsheng Gao and Yixin Lian and Ziyi Zhou and Yuzhuo Fu and Baoyuan Wang},
  abstract={To improve the essential capability of responding and establish a benchmark in the live open-domain scenario, we introduce the LiveChat dataset, composed of 1.33 million real-life Chinese dialogues with almost 3800 average sessions across 351 personas and fine-grained profiles for each persona. LiveChat is automatically constructed by processing numerous live videos on the Internet and naturally falls within the scope of multi-party conversations, where the issues of Who says What to Whom should be considered. },
